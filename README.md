# HitGrid

A real-time multiplayer fantasy game precisely modelling the National Hockey League's salary cap that allows multiple mock trade deadlines.

A user can assume control of a single team in a given created league, and propose and accept cap-compliant trades involving players and draft picks to and from other teams.

Built with Node, Rails and Ember.js.
